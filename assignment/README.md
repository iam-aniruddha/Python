# README: Project Questions and Solutions

## Question I: Given a String of Characters

1. **Print the three most common characters along with their occurrence count.**
2. **Sort in descending order of occurrence count.**
3. **If the occurrence count is the same for any character, sort the characters in alphabetical order.**

### Example:

Input: `HAPPIESTMINDS`

Output:
- `I: 2`
- `P: 2`
- `S: 2`

### Solution Approach:

To solve this problem, we define a function `print_top_characters(s, n=3)` that takes a string `s` and an optional parameter `n` (which specifies the number of top characters to be printed). Within this function, we'll:

1. Use `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. Sort the characters based on their frequency count and alphabetical order.
3. Print the top `n` characters along with their frequencies.

## Question II: Write a Program to List Running Processes

1. **Find the list of all running processes on your system.**
2. **Display the count of each running process.**
3. **Store this information in a CSV file.**

### Solution Approach:

To accomplish this task, we will write a Python program that utilizes the `psutil` module to retrieve the list of running processes on the system. We'll then count the occurrences of each process and display the count. Finally, we'll store this information in a CSV file.

## Question III: Module Description

This module contains a function to monitor the number of instances of a given process and kill the oldest instance if the maximum number of instances is exceeded.

### Function Description:

The function `monitor_app(process_name, max_instance)` monitors the specified app by name and checks the number of instances running. If the number of instances exceeds the specified maximum, it kills the oldest instance.

### Parameters:

- `process_name`: The name of the app to monitor.
- `max_instance`: The maximum number of instances allowed for the app.

### Solution Approach:

We'll implement the function to track instances and manage them based on the specified criteria.

## Question IV(i): Write a Program to Reverse a String with Using Inbuilt Functions

Given an input string, the program should return the reverse of it.

### Solution Approach:

To solve this problem, we can implement a function named `reverse_string(s)` that takes a string `s` as input. Within this function, we split the input string into a list of words, reverse the order of the words, and then join them back into a single string.

---

## Question IV(ii): Write a Program to Reverse a String without Using Inbuilt Functions

Given an input string, the program should return the reverse of it without using any inbuilt functions.

### Solution Approach:

To solve this problem without using inbuilt functions, we can implement a function named `reverse(string)` that takes a string `string` as input. Within this function, we can split the input string into words and then reverse the order of these words using a stack data structure.

### Approach:

1. We initialize an empty stack.
2. We iterate through each word in the input string and push them onto the stack.
3. After pushing all words onto the stack, we pop them from the stack and append them to a list, effectively reversing their order.
4. Finally, we join the reversed words into a single string and return it.

## Question V: Fibonacci Series Generator

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts with 0 and 1.

### Solution Approach:

To generate the Fibonacci series, we can create a function named `generate_fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input. Within this function, we'll calculate the Fibonacci numbers up to the `n`th term and return them as a list.

### Approach:

To generate the Fibonacci series, the program uses a recursive function `fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The function recursively calculates Fibonacci numbers by summing the two preceding Fibonacci numbers until reaching the base cases (n = 1 or n = 2). The program then prompts the user to input the desired number of terms and prints the Fibonacci series up to that number of terms.


# Required Dependencies:

To run the provided code, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x
- psutil module
- decorator module

You can install the `psutil` and `decorator` modules using pip:

`pip install psutil`
`pip install decorator`

The psutil library is used to interact with system processes in a platform independent manner. It provides an API to access system information and process management
